# Brockit

- **Brockit** is a site based on Reddit where members can share links, and other information with the Brockit community. Other members can then post their own comments or related information in response.

### Features:

- Login Authentication
- Password Encryption
- Favoriting/Voting
- Automatic Mailing with Topic Updates

### Technologies used:

- Built with **Ruby** on the **Rails Framework**
- **SQLite/ActiveRecord** for database services
- **Bootstrap-Sass** for styling and SCSS preprocessing(gem)
- **Bcrypt** for password encryption(gem)
- **Sendgrid** for mailing services

### Background

- Brockit is a project I built(10/2017) during the MVC phase of my web developer program at Bloc. A few of the many things I learned from building this site are:
 - how the Model, View and Controller operate and interact within the MVC Framework
 - user authentication and authorization via Ruby
 - mailer functions via Ruby and Sendgrid
 - C.R.U.D. operations
 - Sessions

##### Note: Brockit is still in Development. Plans include
- Photo posting capability
- Fully responsive
- Given a nice theme
